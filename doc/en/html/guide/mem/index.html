<h1>Memory components</h1>

<p>The RAM and ROM components are two of the more useful
components in Logisim's built-in libraries. However, because
of the volume of information they can store, they are also two
of the most complex components.</p>

<p>Documentation about how they work within a circuit can
be found on the <a href="../../libs/mem/ram.html">RAM</a> and
<a href="../../libs/mem/rom.html">ROM</a> pages of the
<em>Library Reference</em>. This section of the <b  class=refguide>User's
Guide</b> explains the interface allowing the user to view
and edit memory contents.</p>
