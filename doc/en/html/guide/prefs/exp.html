<p>These preferences enable features that are considered experimental, inserted to garner user feedback.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Graphics acceleration:</b> One Logisim user observed
that adding <tt>-Dsun.java2d.d3d=True</tt> to the command line seemed to improve Logisim's graphics performance by telling it to use hardware graphics acceleration. This drop-down box attempts to configure Logisim to set this up; reports about whether this drop-down box has any effect on performance would be welcome. It won't have any effect until Logisim is restarted.</p></li>
