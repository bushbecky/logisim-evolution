<h1>Splitters</h1>

<p>When you work with multi-bit values, you will often want to route different bits in different directions. The Wiring library's <b class=propertie>splitter</b> tool (<img class=intxt src="../../../../icons/splitter.gif">) allows you to accomplish this.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want a circuit that computes the bitwise AND of the two nibbles of its eight-bit input (the upper four bits and the lower four bits). We will have an eight-bit value coming from the input pin, and we want to split that into two four-bit values. In the below circuit, we have used a splitter to accomplish this: The 8-bit input comes into the splitter, which divides the 8 bits into two 4-bit values, which are then fed into the AND gate and from there to the output.</p>

<p>In this example, the splitter <b>splits</b> an incoming value into multiple outgoing values. But splitters can also work the other way: It can <b>combine</b> multiple values into a single value. In fact, they are non-directional: They can send values one way at one time and another way later, and they can even do both at the same time, as in the below example where a value travels eastward through the two splitters, then is routed back westward through them again, and then back eastward where it finally reaches its output.</p>

<p>The key to understanding splitters is their attributes. In the following, the term <b>split end</b> refers to one of the multiple wires on one side, while the term <b>combined end</b> refers to the single wire on the other side.</p>
<ul>

<li> The <b class=propertie>Facing</b> attribute tells where the split ends should be relative to the combined end.</li>
<center>
<table>
<tr><br>
<td valign="top">combined end</td>
<td><img  align="center" src="../../../../img-libs/splitter-right.png"></td>
<td>split end</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><img  align="center" src="../../../../img-libs/splitter-right.png"></td>
<td><img  align="center" src="../../../../img-libs/splitter-left.png"></td>
<td><img  align="center" src="../../../../img-libs/splitter-center.png"></td>

</table>
</center>
<li> The <b class=propertie>Fan Out</b> attribute specifies how many split ends there are.</li>

<li> The <b class=propertie>Bit Width In</b> attribute specifies the bit width of the combined end.</li>

<li> The <b class=propertie>Bit <var>x</var></b> attribute says which split end corresponds to bit <em>x</em> of the combined end. If multiple bits correspond to the same split end, then their relative ordering will be the same as in the combined end. Logisim splitters cannot have a bit from the combined end correspond to multiple split ends.</li>

</ul>
<p>Note that any change to the Fan Out or Bit Width In attributes will reset all Bit <var>x</var> attributes so that they will distribute the bits of the combined value as evenly as possible among the split ends.</p>
