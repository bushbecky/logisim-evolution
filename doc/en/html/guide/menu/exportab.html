<h1>Configuring Export</h1>
<p>When you select <b class=menu>|&nbsp;Export Image...&nbsp;|</b>, Logisim displays a dialog box with four options.</P>
<center><img src="../../../img-guide/exporttab.png"></center>
<ul>

<li><b>Circuits:</b> A list where you can select one or more circuits that should be exported into image files. (Empty circuits are not displayed as options.)

<li><b>Image Format:</b> You can create PNG, GIF, and JPEG files. I would recommend PNG files: The GIF format is quite dated, and the JPEG format will introduce artifacts into the image, as the JPEG format is really meant for photographic images.</li>

<li><b>Scale Factor:</b>You can scale the images as they are dumped into image files using this slider.</li>

<li><b>Printer View:</b>Style of the image produced with either the stat information or only the schema.</li>

This option is also available in "<a href="../prefs/layout.html">Print view:</a>" in the export of circuits. This will change the display in the workspace.</li> 

</ul>
<p>After clicking <b class=button>OK</b>, Logisim will display a file selection dialog box. If you have selected one circuit, select the file into which the image should be placed. If you have selected multiple circuits, select a directory where the files should be placed; Logisim will name the images based on the circuits' names (<tt>main.png</tt>, for example).</p>
