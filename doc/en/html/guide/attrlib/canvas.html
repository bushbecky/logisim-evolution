<h1>The Canvas</h1>

<p>The canvas is really the most visible part of Liogisim-evolution is where you draw your circuits and their symbol to finally simulate the operation.</p>

<p>It is composed of only a few elements:<br>

<p><b>Horizontal and vertical scroll bars</b> : They work as in most programs, just drag the sliders to move the view to other parts of the drawing. They can also be manipulated from the keyboard or mouse with the following combinations:<ul><li>Mouse wheel or keys <span class=tkeybd>low/up arrow</span> : vertical scrolling</li><li><span class=tkeybd>Alt</span>-Mouse wheel or keys <span class=tkeybd>right/left arrow</span>: horizontal scrolling </li>
<li>Key <span class=tkeybd>PgUp</span> : go to the top of the page</li>
<li>Key <span class=tkeybd>PgDn</span> : go to bottom of page</li></ul></p>

<p><b>The zoom :</b>On the bottom left is the display of the current zoom factor (100% in the figure). you can change it with the two buttons to the right of the rate display or with <span class=tkeybd>Ctrl</span> + mouse wheel</p><center><img src="../../../../img-guide/zoom.png"></center>
