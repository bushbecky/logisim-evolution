<p>Every Logisim project is actually a library of circuits. In
its simplest form, each project has only one circuit (called
"main" by default), but it is easy to add more:
Select Add Circuit... from the Project menu, and type any name
you like for the new circuit you want to create.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to build a 2-to-1 multiplexer named ">Mux_2to1"
After adding the circuit, Logisim will look like this.</p>
<center><img src="../../../img-guide/subcirc-2-add.png"></center>
<p>In the explorer pane, you can now see that the project now
contains two circuits, "main", and "Mux_2to1" Logisim draws a
magnifying glass over the icon of the circuit currently being
viewed; the current circuit name also appears in the window's
title bar.</p>

<p>After editing the circuit to appear like a 2:1 multiplexer,
we might end up with the following circuit.</p>
